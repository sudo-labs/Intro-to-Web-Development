# Intro-to-Web-Development
We have provided you with the web template for starters and the finished webpage. Use in "Introduction to Web Development".

The folder "Finished", contains the finish product that you will be making at the workshop.

The HTML file "template" is a template for anyone who wishes to use this to develop their personal webpage or/and to use it in another project in the future.
